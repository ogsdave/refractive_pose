refractive_pose
===============

Minimal and near-minimal solvers for the camera resection/absolute pose problem where the camera observes known structure through a known refractive plane.
For details about the solvers, please see the paper
"Absolute Pose for Cameras Under Flat Refractive Interfaces", S. Haner and K. Åström, CVPR 2015.
